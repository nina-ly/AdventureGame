Description 
This application is going to be a game where the user picks the actions that will continue the story. The purpose of the game is entertainment while testing the user’s reasoning skills, attention to detail, and ability to take clues and use them in ways that will allow them to gain more points. The game will be played out as choices given to the user that will lead them to another set of choices. The game will seem straight-forward at first but if the user only chooses their actions from the first ones seen they will realize that they will not get very far. Many of the choices will also have clues in the panel that would lead them to performing a secret action and continue the game in a way that was not previously available to them. The goal is to make a game that the user will want to continue playing to find all the secret actions and ultimately get all the points on the way to the end goal. This is how our game is going to be interesting and entertaining.
